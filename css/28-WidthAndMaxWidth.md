# width and max-width
A block-level element always take up the full width available.
Setting the `width` of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
> **Note**:When the browser window is smaller than the width of the element.The browser than adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using `max-width` instead,in this situation,will improve the browser's handling of small windows.This is important when making a site usable on small devices.
